    <p>I am a professor at Cornell University. My research focuses on algorithms and networks, the roles they play in
        large-scale social and information systems, and their broader societal implications. My work has been supported
        by an NSF Career Award, an ONR Young Investigator Award, a <a href=""> MacArthur Foundation Fellowship,</a> a <a

    <h3>Books and Teaching</h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Since Spring 2021,<a href=""></a> Karen Levy and I have been teaching a course entitled <a href=""></a>. The course is designed at an introductory level with no formal
            prerequisites, and covers a range of ethical, societal, and policy implications of computing and
            information.</li>
        <li>D. Easley, J. Kleinberg. <a href="">Networks, Crowds, and Markets: Reasoning About a Highly Connected World.</a> Cambridge
            University Press, 2010.
            <ul>
                <li><i>This book is based on an inter-disciplinary course that we teach entitled <a href="">Networks</a>. The book,
                        like the course, is designed at the introductory undergraduate level with no formal
                        prerequisites. To support deeper explorations, most of the chapters are supplemented with
                        optional advanced sections.

                <li><i>There is an on-line <a href="">edX</a> course based on the book: <a href="">Networks, Crowds, and Markets,</a> taught jointly
                        with David Easley and Eva Tardos.</i></li>

                <li>
                    This book is based on the undergraduate algorithms course that we both teach. We also use the more
                    advanced parts for our graduate algorithms course.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <li>I teach a PhD-level course on network models, entitled <a href="">The Structure of Information Networks</a> (CS 6850).</li>
